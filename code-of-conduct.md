## How do we plan to collaborate?
Collaboration will be done through in-person meetings twice a week while communication can be done throughout the week through group chat. The main purpose of in-person meetings will be to perform code review and plan for future assignment/tasks. While, online communication can be used to discuss issues occuring on the way.

Gitlab and Whatsapp will be the main source to collaborate on issues throughout the project.

## How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
Biweekly Scrum meetings, every Monday and Friday to discuss team retrospectives(i.e issues faced and work done in the particular sprint). These retrospectives will be documented to show what went well and what could be improved.


## How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
Open communication channels which promotes questions being presented. Open communications allows team members to question certain aspects about the code and allow successful knowledge transfer. Another way is to have a set rules and procedures that are followed throughout the process ensuring that there is no issue with the required skillset and the knowledge is acknowledged across the group.  

## What is our usual communication plan?
Our communication plan involves regular updates through both scheduled meetings and informal channels like group chat. We'll prioritize clarity and responsiveness to ensure that everyone remains informed and engaged throughout the project.

## How will we solve conflicts?
The conflicts will be resolved in a democratic manner through logical reasoning of the various sides of the conflict topic with discussion and conclusion on the issue. 


## How do you plan to ensure responsible use of LLMs in your project and how do you transparently and traceably document the use of LLMs?
To ensure the responsiblity of the use of LLMs would be through commenting code (specific lines along with the LLM used). Furthermore, the code used from LLM must be tested and altered based on the other code developed and not be blindly pasted into the project.
